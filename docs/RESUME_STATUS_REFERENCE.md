# Resume Status Reference

**Authoritative documentation for resume registry status values.**

Each status represents the most recent state of a resume in the ARCHER pipeline. When an operation fails, status is updated to reflect the failure (e.g., `parsing_failed` not `normalized`).

## Historical Resume Statuses

Historical resumes progress through processing stages to make them available for analysis and content extraction.

### `raw`
Original `.tex` file from archive (`data/resume_archive/`), not yet processed. Contains LaTeX comments, inconsistent formatting.

### `normalized`
Comments removed, whitespace standardized, ready for parsing. Generated by `process_latex_archive.py` with `normalize=True`.

### `parsed`
Successfully converted to structured YAML format. Resume is now available for targeting context to query via `ResumeDocument` API.

---

## Generated Resume Statuses

Generated resumes progress through the full pipeline: content selection → template population → PDF compilation.

### `pending`
Queued for processing but not yet started. Awaiting available resources or manual trigger.
